# KiCAD MCP Server - Complete Tool Inventory

**Version:** 2.2.3+ (post-release `main`)
**Total Tools:** 151 (verified via MCP `tools/list` against KiCAD 10.0.3)
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-27

**What changed since 137:** registered `execute_tool` (router passthrough),
`get_backend_info`, and the seven `ipc_*` tools (`ipc_add_track`, `ipc_add_via`,
`ipc_add_text`, `ipc_list_components`, `ipc_get_tracks`, `ipc_get_vias`,
`ipc_save_board`). Net +9 tools. See `CHANGELOG.md` for the full list of
MCP-protocol-level fixes from this session.

## How Tools Are Organized

Tools are registered directly via `server.tool()`

The `Access` column below uses legacy labels from when a router pattern was planned:

- **Direct** — High-frequency tools, originally intended as always-visible
- **Routed** — Originally planned for router dispatch; now also registered directly
- **Additional** — Registered directly (always visible)
