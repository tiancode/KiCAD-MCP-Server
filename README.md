# KiCAD MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with KiCAD for PCB design automation. Built on the MCP 2025-06-18 specification, this server provides comprehensive tool schemas and real-time project state access for intelligent PCB design workflows.

> This project began as a fork of [mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server](https://github.com/mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server) and is now developed and maintained independently. See [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments) for credits to the original project.

## Overview

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard from Anthropic that allows AI assistants to securely connect to external tools and data sources. This implementation provides a standardized bridge between AI assistants and KiCAD, enabling natural language control of PCB design operations.

**Key Capabilities:**

- 174 tools with JSON Schema validation, each registered directly as an MCP tool
- 8 dynamic resources exposing project state
- Complete schematic workflow with 27 tools and dynamic symbol loading (~10,000 symbols)
- Freerouting autorouter integration (Java, Docker, or Podman)
- Custom footprint and symbol creation tools
- JLCPCB parts integration with 2.5M+ component catalog and local library search
- Datasheet enrichment via LCSC
- Full MCP 2025-06-18 protocol compliance
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Real-time KiCAD UI integration via IPC API (experimental)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## What's New (post-2.2.3, on `main`)

### Faster startup, lazy symbol library

The biggest user-visible regression in older builds was a 30 – 120 s
startup pause while every `.kicad_sym` file in the global library was
parsed up front. That eager warm is **opt-in via
`KICAD_MCP_EAGER_SYMBOL_CACHE=1`** now. The default path is lazy —
libraries are parsed on first `list_symbols(nickname)` call. A
persistent disk cache at `~/.kicad-mcp/cache/symbol_libraries.pickle`
with per-library mtime validation means even broad
`search_symbols` calls are fast on subsequent runs.

### KiCAD 10 + Flatpak ergonomics

End-to-end tested against KiCAD 10.0.3 (Flathub Flatpak):

- IPC socket auto-detected under
  `~/.var/app/org.kicad.KiCad/cache/tmp/kicad/api.sock` and the macOS
  sandbox equivalent — no more manually setting `KICAD_API_SOCKET`.
- `fp-lib-table` / `sym-lib-table` auto-discovered in the sandbox
  config dir.
- `KICAD10_FOOTPRINT_DIR` / `KICAD10_SYMBOL_DIR` recognised; the
  Flatpak runtime library extension at
  `/var/lib/flatpak/runtime/org.kicad.KiCad.Library.Footprints/.../files/footprints`
  is probed as a last resort.
- KiCAD-10 version detection no longer reports "unknown" when the
  installed kipy is one patch version behind.

### MCP-protocol fixes

- The router/registry discovery layer (`list_tool_categories`,
  `search_tools`, `execute_tool`, …) was removed. Every tool is
  registered directly as an MCP tool and called by name, so the
  meta-tools and the hand-maintained category registry no longer earned
  their maintenance cost.
- `get_backend_info` and seven `ipc_*` tools (`ipc_list_components`,
  `ipc_add_track`, etc.) now have proper MCP wrappers; previously
  only the Python handlers existed.
- `get_backend_state` reports the correct project / board paths in
  IPC mode.

### Server architecture refactor

`python/kicad_interface.py` shrank from **6 668 → 2 797 lines (−58 %)**.
81 inline `_handle_*` methods moved into a new `python/handlers/`
package (one module per tool category); a single `__getattr__` +
`_HANDLER_MAP` replaces the 80 trampoline methods. See
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the new layout.

### Cleanup that also shipped

- `LOG_LEVEL` env var is now honoured by the Python side too (was
  hardcoded `DEBUG`).
- CI workflow no longer masks failures with `|| echo "... not
configured yet"`; the 19 pollution failures it used to hide were
  root-caused and fixed.
- `express` dropped (`npm audit --high` → 0 vulnerabilities).
- `scripts/swig_smoke_test.py` runs the full create-project → place
  components → route → save chain against real `pcbnew` for catching
  regressions pytest's MagicMock can't see.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list.

## What's New in v2.2.3

### New Tools: FFC/Ribbon Cable Passthrough Workflow

A complete workflow for designing passthrough adapter boards (e.g. Raspberry Pi CSI
cable adapters) is now supported:

1. `connect_passthrough` — wires all pins of one connector to the matching pins of
   another in the schematic (J1 pin N → J2 pin N, auto-named nets).
2. `sync_schematic_to_board` — imports the net assignments into the PCB.
3. `route_pad_to_pad` — routes each connection with automatic via insertion when
   pads are on opposite copper layers.
4. `snapshot_project` — saves a named checkpoint into `<project>/snapshots/`.

### Bug Fixes (KiCAD 9 / Windows)

- **Via insertion for B.Cu footprints** — `route_pad_to_pad` now correctly detects
  when a footprint is on B.Cu and inserts the required via. (KiCAD 9 SWIG returned
  `F.Cu` for all SMD pads regardless of layer — fixed.)
- **Board outline rounded corners** — `add_board_outline` now correctly applies
  `cornerRadius` when `shape="rounded_rectangle"`.
- **B.Cu placement hang** — placing a footprint on B.Cu no longer causes a ~30s
  freeze in KiCAD 9.

### Developer Mode

Set `KICAD_MCP_DEV=1` in your Claude Desktop MCP environment to automatically save
the MCP session log into the project's `logs/` folder on every `export_gerber` and
`snapshot_project` call. Useful for debugging and for attaching to GitHub issues.

```json
"env": {
  "KICAD_MCP_DEV": "1"
}
```

> **Privacy warning:** The session log contains your full tool call history
> (including file paths and design details). **Review or delete `logs/` before
> sharing a project directory publicly.**

## What's New in v2.1.0

### Critical Schematic Workflow Fix + Complete Wiring System (Issue #26)

The schematic workflow was completely broken in previous versions - **this is now fixed AND dramatically enhanced!**

**What was broken:**

- `create_project` only created PCB files, no schematics
- `add_schematic_component` called non-existent API methods
- Schematics couldn't be created or edited at all
- Only 13 component types available (severe limitation)
- No working wire/connection functionality

**Complete Implementation (3 Phases):**

**Phase 1: Component Placement Foundation**

- `create_project` now creates both .kicad_pcb and .kicad_sch files
- Added pre-configured template schematics with 13 common component types
- Rewrote component placement to use proper `clone()` API

**Phase 2: Dynamic Symbol Loading (BREAKTHROUGH!)**

- **Access to ALL ~10,000 KiCad symbols** from standard libraries
- Automatic detection and dynamic loading from `.kicad_sym` library files
- Zero configuration required - just specify library and symbol name
- Seamless integration with existing MCP tools
- Full S-expression parsing and injection system

**Phase 3: Intelligent Wiring System (NEW in v2.1.0)**

- **Automatic pin location discovery** with rotation support (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
- **Smart wire routing** (direct, orthogonal horizontal-first, orthogonal vertical-first)
- **Power symbol support** (VCC, GND, +3V3, +5V, etc.)
- **Wire graph analysis** - geometric tracing for net connectivity
- **Net label management** (local, global, hierarchical labels)
- **Netlist generation** with accurate component/pin connections

**Technical Architecture:**
The kicad-skip library cannot create symbols or wires from scratch. We implemented a comprehensive solution:

1. **Static Templates:** 13 pre-configured symbols (R, C, L, LED, etc.) for instant use
2. **Dynamic Loading:** On-demand injection of ANY symbol from KiCad libraries:
   - Parse `.kicad_sym` library files using S-expression parser
   - Inject symbol definition into schematic's `lib_symbols` section
   - Create offscreen template instance
   - Reload schematic so kicad-skip sees new template
   - Clone template to create actual component
3. **Wire Creation:** S-expression-based wire injection (bypasses kicad-skip API limitations)
4. **Pin Discovery:** Parse symbol definitions, apply rotation transformations, calculate absolute positions
5. **Connectivity Analysis:** Geometric wire tracing to build net connection graphs

**Example - Complete Circuit Creation:**

```python
# Load power symbols dynamically
loader.load_symbol_dynamically(sch_path, "power", "VCC")

# Place components with auto-rotation
ComponentManager.add_component(sch, {
    "type": "STM32F103C8Tx",
    "library": "MCU_ST_STM32F1",
    "reference": "U1",
    "x": 100, "y": 100, "rotation": 0
})

# Connect with intelligent routing
ConnectionManager.add_connection(sch_path, "U1", "1", "R1", "2", routing="orthogonal_h")

# Connect to power nets
ConnectionManager.connect_to_net(sch_path, "U1", "VDD", "VCC")

# Analyze connectivity
connections = ConnectionManager.get_net_connections(sch, "VCC", sch_path)
# Returns: [{"component": "U1", "pin": "VDD"}, {"component": "R1", "pin": "1"}]
```

**Test Results:**

- Component placement: 100% passing
- Dynamic symbol loading: 10,000+ symbols accessible
- Wire creation: 100% passing (8/8 connections in test circuit)
- Pin discovery: Rotation-aware, sub-millimeter accuracy
- Net connectivity: 100% accurate (VCC: 2 connections, GND: 4 connections)
- Netlist generation: Working with accurate pin-level connections

See [Schematic Tools Reference](docs/SCHEMATIC_TOOLS_REFERENCE.md) for the complete schematic tool documentation.

### IPC Backend (Experimental)

We are currently implementing and testing the KiCAD 9.0 IPC API for real-time UI synchronization:

- Changes made via MCP tools appear immediately in the KiCAD UI
- No manual reload required when IPC is active
- Hybrid backend: uses IPC when available, falls back to SWIG API
- IPC runtime reconnect: if MCP has fallen back to SWIG, IPC-capable board
  tools retry IPC after KiCAD launches instead of staying on SWIG for the entire
  session
- 20+ commands now support IPC including routing, component placement, and zone operations

Note: IPC features are under active development and testing. Enable IPC in KiCAD via Preferences > Plugins > Enable IPC API Server.

### Tools

Every tool is registered directly as an MCP tool and is callable by name — there
is no router/registry indirection or `execute_tool` gateway. Just ask naturally
("export gerber files", "add mounting holes") and Claude calls the appropriate
tool.

### NEEDS TESTING - REPORT ISSUES

### JLCPCB Parts Integration (New!)

Complete integration with JLCPCB's parts catalog, providing two complementary approaches for component selection:

**Dual-Mode Architecture:**

1. **Local Symbol Libraries** - Search JLCPCB libraries installed via KiCAD Plugin and Content Manager (contributed by [@l3wi](https://github.com/l3wi))
2. **JLCPCB API Integration** - Access the complete 2.5M+ parts catalog with real-time pricing and stock data

**Key Features:**

- Real-time pricing with quantity breaks (1+, 10+, 100+, 1000+)
- Stock availability checking
- Basic vs Extended library type identification (Basic = free assembly)
- Intelligent cost optimization with alternative part suggestions
- Package-to-footprint mapping for KiCAD compatibility
- Parametric search by category, package, manufacturer
- Local SQLite database for fast offline searching
- No API credentials required for local library search

**Why this matters:** JLCPCB offers PCB assembly services where Basic parts have no assembly fee, while Extended parts charge $3 per unique component. This integration helps you find the cheapest components with the best availability, potentially saving hundreds of dollars on assembly costs for production runs.

See [JLCPCB Usage Guide](docs/JLCPCB_USAGE_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

### Comprehensive Tool Schemas

Every tool now includes complete JSON Schema definitions with:

- Detailed parameter descriptions and constraints
- Input validation with type checking
- Required vs. optional parameter specifications
- Enumerated values for categorical inputs
- Clear documentation of what each tool does

- **Windows 10/11** - Fully supported with automated setup
- **macOS** - Experimental support

## Installation

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Install KiCAD 9.0 or higher
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:kicad/kicad-9.0-releases
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kicad kicad-libraries

# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/tiancode/KiCAD-MCP-Server.git
cd KiCAD-MCP-Server
npm install
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
npm run build

# Verify
python3 -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.GetBuildVersion())"
```

### Windows 10/11

**Automated Setup (Recommended):**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/tiancode/KiCAD-MCP-Server.git
cd KiCAD-MCP-Server
.\setup-windows.ps1
```

The script will:

- Detect KiCAD installations, including both machine-wide installs under
  `C:\Program Files\KiCad` and per-user installs under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\KiCad`
- Verify prerequisites
- Install dependencies
- Build project
- Generate configuration
- Run diagnostics

**Manual Setup:**
Run `.\setup-windows.ps1` from PowerShell — the script auto-detects your
KiCAD install, configures Python paths, builds the project, and writes
your Claude Desktop MCP config. See [Windows Troubleshooting](docs/WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
if it fails.

### macOS

**Important:** On macOS, use KiCAD's bundled Python to ensure proper access to the `pcbnew` module.

#### Manual Setup

```bash
# Install KiCAD 9.0 from kicad.org/download/macos

# Install Node.js
brew install node@20

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/tiancode/KiCAD-MCP-Server.git
cd KiCAD-MCP-Server

# Create virtual environment using KiCAD's bundled Python
/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run build
```

**Note:** The `--system-site-packages` flag is required to access KiCAD's `pcbnew` module from the virtual environment.

#### Automated Setup

To simplify configuration with Claude Desktop, this repository provides a macOS setup script:

```bash
./setup-macos.sh
```

In case of error `zsh: permission denied: ./setup-macos.sh` you can either:

- always allow the script to be executed by running: `chmod +x setup-macos.sh`.
- alternatively explicitly run it with bash: `bash setup-macos.sh` so no chmod change needed.

This script does **not replace the manual setup above** — it assumes dependencies are already installed and the project is built. Instead, it automates:

- detection of your environment (Node.js, KiCad Python, `pcbnew`)
- resolving the correct macOS `PYTHONPATH`
- generating the correct Claude Desktop MCP configuration
- safely merging the configuration into your existing Claude config
- optionally writing the configuration with backup support

##### Basic Usage

###### Verify setup (no changes)

```bash
./setup-macos.sh --verify
```

###### Preview configuration (dry run)

```bash
./setup-macos.sh --dry-run
```

###### Apply configuration

```bash
./setup-macos.sh --apply
```

After applying, restart Claude Desktop.

##### Parameters

###### Required parameters

None. The script works out-of-the-box using sensible defaults.

###### Optional parameters

##### `--name NAME`

Specify the MCP server name in Claude Desktop.

Default:

```text
kicad
```

Example:

```bash
./setup-macos.sh --apply --name kicad-dev
```

Use this when:

- running multiple MCP configurations
- testing forks or development versions
- avoiding overwriting an existing setup

##### `--claude-config PATH`

Specify a custom Claude Desktop configuration file.

Default:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Example:

```bash
./setup-macos.sh --dry-run --claude-config ~/tmp/claude_config.json
```

Use this when:

- testing configurations safely
- using non-standard config locations
- debugging without modifying your main setup

##### `--yes`

Skip confirmation prompt when applying changes.

Example:

```bash
./setup-macos.sh --apply --yes
```

##### After Setup

1. Fully quit Claude Desktop
2. Reopen Claude Desktop
3. Open a new chat
4. Click **+ → Connectors**
5. Verify the server appears (e.g. `kicad` or your custom name)

Test with prompt in Claude Desktop:

```text
Use the kicad MCP server to run check_kicad_ui.
```

##### Notes

- The script only modifies the `mcpServers` section and leaves all other configuration untouched
- Existing configurations are automatically backed up before changes
- macOS support relies on KiCad’s bundled Python; system Python will not work correctly
- If KiCad is updated or moved, re-run the script to refresh paths

---

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Edit configuration file:

- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kicad": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/KiCAD-MCP-Server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/kicad/python",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Platform-specific PYTHONPATH:**

- **Linux:** `/usr/lib/kicad/lib/python3/dist-packages`
- **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0\lib\python3\dist-packages` or
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\KiCad\10.0\lib\python3\dist-packages`
- **macOS:** `/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages`

#### Linux Python Detection

The server automatically detects Python on Linux in this priority order:

1. **Virtual environment** - `venv/bin/python` or `.venv/bin/python` (highest priority)
2. **KICAD_PYTHON env var** - User override for non-standard installations
3. **KiCad bundled Python** - `/usr/lib/kicad/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/lib/kicad/bin/python3`, `/opt/kicad/bin/python3`
4. **System Python via which** - Resolves `which python3` to absolute path (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3`)
5. **Common system paths** - `/usr/bin/python3`, `/bin/python3`

**For most standard Linux installations (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch), no KICAD_PYTHON configuration is needed** - the server will automatically find your Python installation.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you see "Python executable not found: python3", you can manually specify the Python path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kicad": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/KiCAD-MCP-Server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "KICAD_PYTHON": "/usr/bin/python3",
        "PYTHONPATH": "/usr/lib/kicad/lib/python3/dist-packages"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To find your Python path:

```bash
which python3  # Example output: /usr/bin/python3
python3 -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.GetBuildVersion())"  # Verify pcbnew access
```

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

Copy the template to your workspace:

```bash
cp config/vscode-mcp.example.json .vscode/mcp.json
```

VS Code will auto-detect `.vscode/mcp.json` and register the server. The template uses `${workspaceFolder}` so no path editing is needed.

> **Note:** `.vscode/mcp.json` is listed in `.gitignore` — your local configuration won't be committed.

### Cline (VSCode)

Edit: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

Use the same configuration format as Claude Desktop above.

### Claude Code

Claude Code automatically detects MCP servers in the current directory. No additional configuration needed.

### OpenCode (Windows)

OpenCode uses a different MCP configuration schema than Claude Desktop. Use
`setup-windows-opencode.ps1` to verify the local setup and write the correct
OpenCode `mcp` entry.

OpenCode project configuration is written to `opencode.json` in the target
project root. The script keeps the KiCAD MCP server repository separate from the
target project:

- `McpServerPath` is this repository, where `dist/index.js` is built
- `ProjectPath` is the project that should receive `opencode.json`

**When this is useful:**

- You use [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) as your MCP client on Windows
- You want a project-local MCP server available only in one project
- You want a global OpenCode MCP server available from any workspace
- You need to verify KiCAD Python (`pcbnew`), Node.js, and `dist/index.js`
  before changing OpenCode configuration

#### Verify setup without changes

Use this first when diagnosing installation or path problems. It detects KiCAD,
tests `pcbnew`, checks Node.js, and verifies the built MCP entrypoint.

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -Verify -SkipInstall -SkipBuild
```

#### Preview OpenCode configuration

Use dry run mode when you want to inspect the exact JSON before writing it.

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -DryRun -SkipInstall -SkipBuild
```

Example generated OpenCode shape:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "kicad": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node", "C:\\path\\to\\KiCAD-MCP-Server\\dist\\index.js"],
      "environment": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "KICAD_AUTO_LAUNCH": "false",
        "KICAD_MCP_DEV": "0",
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:\\Program Files\\KiCad\\10.0\\bin\\Lib\\site-packages"
      },
      "enabled": true,
      "timeout": 30000
    }
  }
}
```

A copyable template is also provided at `config/opencode.json`. Replace the
placeholder paths before using it directly.

#### Apply project-local configuration

Use this when you only want KiCAD MCP enabled for one project. The script writes
`opencode.json` in the target project root and backs up an existing file before
changing it.

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -Apply -Scope project
```

By default, `ProjectPath` is the current working directory.

To configure another project, pass `-ProjectPath`:

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -Apply -Scope project -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\your-project"
```

If the setup script is not located in the KiCAD MCP Server repository, pass
`-McpServerPath` so the generated config points to the correct `dist/index.js`:

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 `
  -Apply `
  -Scope project `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\your-project" `
  -McpServerPath "C:\path\to\KiCAD-MCP-Server"
```

#### Apply global OpenCode configuration

Use this when you want the KiCAD MCP server available from any OpenCode
workspace. The script writes `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\opencode.json`.

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -Apply -Scope global
```

#### Use a custom MCP server name

Use this when testing multiple forks or keeping separate development and stable
KiCAD MCP entries.

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -Apply -Scope project -Name kicad-dev
```

#### Use a custom KiCAD installation path

Use this when KiCAD is installed outside the standard Windows locations.

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -Apply -Scope project -KiCadRoot "D:\Apps\KiCad\10.0"
```

#### Skip install or build steps

Use these flags when dependencies are already installed or the project is
already built.

```powershell
.\setup-windows-opencode.ps1 -Apply -Scope project -SkipInstall -SkipBuild
```

#### After applying configuration

1. Fully quit OpenCode.
2. Start OpenCode again so it reloads `opencode.json`.
3. Ask OpenCode to use the `kicad` MCP server and run `check_kicad_ui`.

#### Disable the OpenCode MCP server

To disable the server without removing the full configuration, set the entry to
`enabled: false` and restart OpenCode.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "kicad": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

If OpenCode is running, the MCP server process is managed by OpenCode and
normally stops when OpenCode exits.

### JLCPCB Integration Setup (Optional)

The JLCPCB integration provides two modes that can be used independently or together:

**Mode 1: JLCSearch Public API (Recommended - No Setup Required)**

The easiest way to access JLCPCB's parts catalog:

- No API credentials needed
- No JLCPCB account required
- Access to 2.5M+ parts with pricing and stock data
- Download time: 40-60 minutes for full catalog (100-part batches due to API limit)

To download the database:

```
Ask Claude: "Download the JLCPCB parts database"
```

This creates a local SQLite database at `data/jlcpcb_parts.db` (3-5 GB for full 2.5M+ part catalog).

**Mode 2: Local Symbol Libraries (No Setup Required)**

Install JLCPCB libraries via KiCAD's Plugin and Content Manager:

1. Open KiCAD
2. Go to Tools > Plugin and Content Manager
3. Search for "JLCPCB" or "JLC"
4. Install libraries like `JLCPCB-KiCAD-Library` or `EDA_MCP`
5. Use `search_symbols` to find components with pre-configured footprints and LCSC IDs

**Mode 3: Official JLCPCB API (Advanced - Requires Enterprise Account)**

For users with JLCPCB enterprise accounts and order history:

1. **Get API Credentials**
   - Log in to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
   - Navigate to Account > API Management (requires enterprise approval)
   - Create API Key and save your `appKey` and `appSecret`
   - Note: This requires prior order history and enterprise account approval

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`):

   ```bash
   export JLCPCB_API_KEY="your_app_key_here"
   export JLCPCB_API_SECRET="your_app_secret_here"
   ```

   Or create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```
   JLCPCB_API_KEY=your_app_key_here
   JLCPCB_API_SECRET=your_app_secret_here
   ```

See [JLCPCB Usage Guide](docs/JLCPCB_USAGE_GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation.

## Usage Examples

### Basic PCB Design Workflow

```text
Create a new KiCAD project named 'LEDBoard' in my Documents folder.
Set the board size to 50mm x 50mm and add a rectangular outline.
Place a mounting hole at each corner, 3mm from the edges, with 3mm diameter.
Add text 'LED Controller v1.0' on the front silkscreen at position x=25mm, y=45mm.
```

### Component Placement

```text
Place an LED at x=10mm, y=10mm using footprint LED_SMD:LED_0805_2012Metric.
Create a grid of 4 resistors (R1-R4) starting at x=20mm, y=20mm with 5mm spacing.
Align all resistors horizontally and distribute them evenly.
```

### Routing

```text
Create a net named 'LED1' and route a 0.3mm trace from R1 pad 2 to LED1 anode.
Add a copper pour for GND on the bottom layer covering the entire board.
Create a differential pair for USB_P and USB_N with 0.2mm width and 0.15mm gap.
```

### Autoroute with Freerouting

Automatically route all unconnected nets using the [Freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) autorouter.

**Setup (one-time):**

```bash
# 1. Download the Freerouting JAR
mkdir -p ~/.kicad-mcp
curl -L -o ~/.kicad-mcp/freerouting.jar \
  https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting/releases/download/v2.0.1/freerouting-2.0.1-executable.jar

# 2. Runtime — pick ONE:
#    Option A: Docker (recommended, no Java install needed)
docker pull eclipse-temurin:21-jre

#    Option B: Install Java 21+ locally
#    (Ubuntu/Debian) sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre
```

The autorouter auto-detects which runtime is available (Java 21+ direct, or Docker/Podman fallback).

```text
Check if Freerouting is ready on my system.
Autoroute the current board using Freerouting with a 5-minute timeout.
```

**Step-by-step workflow:**

```text
1. Open the project at ~/Projects/LEDBoard/LEDBoard.kicad_pcb
2. Check Freerouting dependencies are installed
3. Run autoroute with max 10 passes
4. Run DRC to verify the autorouted result
5. Export Gerbers to the fabrication folder
```

**Manual DSN/SES workflow** (for advanced users or external autorouters):

```text
Export the board to Specctra DSN format.
# ... run Freerouting GUI or another autorouter externally ...
Import the routed SES file from ~/Projects/LEDBoard/LEDBoard.ses
```

### Design Verification

```text
Set design rules with 0.15mm clearance and 0.2mm minimum track width.
Run a design rule check and show me any violations.
Export Gerber files to the 'fabrication' folder.
```

### Using Resources

Resources provide read-only access to project state:

```text
Show me the current component list.
What are the current design rules?
Display the board preview.
List all electrical nets.
```

### JLCPCB Component Selection

**Finding Components with Local Libraries:**

```text
Search for ESP32 modules in JLCPCB libraries.
Find a 10k resistor in 0603 package from installed libraries.
Show me details for LCSC part C2934196.
```

**Optimizing Costs with JLCPCB API:**

```text
Search for 10k ohm resistors in 0603 package, only Basic parts.
Find the cheapest capacitor 10uF 25V in 0805 package with good stock.
Show me pricing and stock for JLCPCB part C25804.
Suggest cheaper alternatives to C25804.
```

**Complete Design Workflow:**

```text
I'm designing a board with an ESP32 and need to select components for JLCPCB assembly.
Search JLCPCB for ESP32-C3 modules.
Find Basic parts for: 10k resistor 0603, 100nF capacitor 0603, LED 0805.
For each component, show me the cheapest option with good stock availability.
Place these components on my board using the suggested footprints.
```

**Database Management:**

```text
Download the JLCPCB parts database (first time setup).
Show me JLCPCB database statistics.
How many Basic parts are available?
```

## Architecture

### MCP Protocol Layer

- **JSON-RPC 2.0 Transport:** Bi-directional communication via STDIO
- **Protocol Version:** MCP 2025-06-18
- **Capabilities:** Tools (174), Resources (8)
- **Error Handling:** Standard JSON-RPC error codes

### TypeScript Server (`src/`)

- Implements MCP protocol specification
- Manages Python subprocess lifecycle
- Handles message routing and validation
- Provides logging and error recovery
- All tools registered directly as MCP tools (one file per category in `src/tools/`)

### Python Interface (`python/`)

- **kicad_interface.py:** Main entry point, MCP message handler, command routing
- **kicad_api/:** IPC backend implementation
  - `base.py` - Abstract base classes (`KiCADBackend` / `BoardAPI`)
  - `ipc_backend.py` - KiCAD IPC API backend (real-time UI sync)
  - (The SWIG path is not a backend object — it is direct `pcbnew` access
    behind `KiCADInterface.command_routes` in `kicad_interface.py`.)
- **schemas/tool_schemas.py:** JSON Schema definitions for all tools
- **resources/resource_definitions.py:** Resource handlers and URIs
- **commands/:** Modular command implementations

  - `library_symbol.py` - Symbol library search (local JLCPCB libraries)
  - `jlcpcb.py` - JLCPCB API client
  - `jlcpcb_parts.py` - JLCPCB parts database manager

### KiCAD Integration

- **pcbnew API (SWIG):** Direct Python bindings to KiCAD for file operations
- **IPC API (kipy):** Real-time communication with running KiCAD instance (experimental)
- **Hybrid Backend:** Automatically uses IPC when available, falls back to SWIG
- **kicad-skip:** Schematic file manipulation
- **Platform Detection:** Cross-platform path handling
- **UI Management:** Automatic KiCAD UI launch/detection

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Appearing in Client

**Symptoms:** MCP server doesn't show up in Claude Desktop or Cline

**Solutions:**

1. Verify build completed: `ls dist/index.js`
2. Check configuration paths are absolute
3. Restart MCP client completely
4. Check client logs for error messages

### Python Module Import Errors

**Symptoms:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pcbnew'`

**Solutions:**

1. Verify KiCAD installation: `python3 -c "import pcbnew"`
2. Check PYTHONPATH in configuration matches your KiCAD installation
3. Ensure KiCAD was installed with Python support

### Tool Execution Failures

**Symptoms:** Tools fail with unclear errors

**Solutions:**

1. Check server logs: `~/.kicad-mcp/logs/kicad_interface.log`
2. Verify a project is loaded before running board operations
3. Ensure file paths are absolute, not relative
4. Check tool parameter types match schema requirements

### Windows-Specific Issues

**Symptoms:** Server fails to start on Windows

**Solutions:**

1. Run automated diagnostics: `.\setup-windows.ps1`
2. Verify Python path uses double backslashes: `C:\\Program Files\\KiCad\\10.0`
3. Check Windows Event Viewer for Node.js errors
4. See [Windows Troubleshooting Guide](docs/WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Getting Help

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tiancode/KiCAD-MCP-Server/issues)
2. Review server logs: `~/.kicad-mcp/logs/kicad_interface.log`
3. Open a new issue with:
   - Operating system and version
   - KiCAD version (`python3 -c "import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.GetBuildVersion())"`)
   - Node.js version (`node --version`)
   - Full error message and stack trace
   - Relevant log excerpts
